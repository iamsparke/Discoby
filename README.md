 # DISCOBY: Build Discord Bots 10x Faster ðŸš€

## Introduction

Welcome to **DISCOBY**! This tool is designed to help you build Discord bots quickly and easily, whether you're interested in creating a **Moderation Bot**, a **Music Bot**, or a **Game Bot**. DISCOBY doesn't just generate bot scriptsâ€”it includes an **in-built code editor** that allows you to customize the code instantly.

With **DISCOBY**, you can:
- **Generate pre-built Discord bot templates** for Moderation, Music, or Game bots.
- **Edit the generated scripts** on-the-fly with a built-in editor.
- Get your bot up and running in minutes!

Whether you're a beginner or a pro, DISCOBY has something for everyone.

## How It Works

1. **Select the type of bot** you want to create:
    - Moderation Bot
    - Music Bot
    - Game Bot
    
2. DISCOBY generates the corresponding bot script and saves it as a `.py` file on your device.

3. **Edit the script directly** within the tool using the in-built editor. You can add new commands, tweak the code, and save your changesâ€”all without leaving the program!

4. Once you're done, just copy your **Discord Bot Token** into the script, and you're ready to deploy your bot to Discord! ðŸŽ‰

## Features

- **Interactive Interface**: DISCOBY guides you through each step with a clean, colorful, and fun command-line interface.
- **Auto-Generated Bot Scripts**: Automatically generates bot scripts in Python (`discord.py`) for Moderation, Music, or Game bots.
- **In-built Code Editor**: Edit the generated Python code directly from within the tool and save your changes instantly.
- **Easy Setup**: No need to jump between toolsâ€”DISCOBY helps you from script generation to customization.
- **Human-Friendly Design**: Enjoy using the tool with its friendly prompts and clear navigation.

- Python 3.x
- `discord.py` library (`pip install discord.py`)

If you're using **Termux** (on Android), follow these steps:

1. **Install Python and Git**:

    ```bash
    pkg update
    pkg upgrade
    pkg install python-pip
    pkg install colorma
    pkg install python git
    ```

    python discoby.py
    ```

## Usage

Once you run the script, DISCOBY will guide you through the process:

1. It will ask for your nickname, so it can make things a bit more personal.
2. You'll be asked to select the type of Discord bot you want to create: Moderation, Music, or Game.
3. The selected bot template will be generated and saved as a `.py` file on your device.
4. You will then be given the option to edit the file using DISCOBYâ€™s in-built code editor.
5. Once you're happy with your script, simply add your **Discord Bot Token** into the generated file and run it!

## Example: Generating a Moderation Bot

If you choose to generate a **Moderation Bot**, DISCOBY will create a file called `Moderation_Bot.py` containing a basic structure for a Discord bot that can:

- Ban users
- Kick users
- Unban users

You can then use DISCOBYâ€™s built-in editor to customize the bot further.

## Future Features ðŸš€

We're planning to add more cool features like:
- More Discord bot templates (e.g., Economy bots, Fun bots)
- Additional editing capabilities within the in-built editor
- More Discord API integrations for advanced bot functionalities
